#### 🧠 Overview
The NetworkSecurity project is designed to analyze network data and detect potential security threats using machine learning algorithms. It automates the process of monitoring network traffic, identifying unusual patterns, and alerting administrators to possible intrusions.​

#### 🚀 Features
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes trained models to detect anomalies in network traffic.

Automated Data Processing: Processes and analyzes network data in real-time.

Dockerized Deployment: Containerized application for easy deployment and scalability.

CI/CD Pipeline: Integrated GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

AWS ECR Integration: Pushes Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry for deployment.​

#### 🏗️ Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture:​

Data Collection: Gathers network traffic data for analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for model input.

Model Training: Trains machine learning models to recognize normal and abnormal patterns.

Prediction Engine: Applies trained models to incoming data to detect anomalies.

Alert System: Notifies administrators of potential threats.​
